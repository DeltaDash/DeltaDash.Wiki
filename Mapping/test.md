Anyone who plays rhythm games is already well-versed in **yaseta**'s hardcore and electro swing fusion. Games like *pop'n music*, *Ongeki*, *maimai*, and *SOUND VOLTEX* have already showcased **yaseta**'s sound, and osu! is joining the party today.

We've snagged **10** unmatched tunes for [**yaseta**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/342), all of which come pre-packaged with timing (because we know how boring that can be).

Preview a few tracks for yourself:

There's more where that came from. [**yaseta**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/342) has 10 songs, pre-timed and waiting just for you. Yes, we're talking to you, Kevin. Fulfill the prophecy, Kevin.

If your life isn't hinged on a mapping prophecy, feel free to wait until our next Featured Artist is announced to start mapping. Keep an eye on the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) for news about that and everything else circle-related.
