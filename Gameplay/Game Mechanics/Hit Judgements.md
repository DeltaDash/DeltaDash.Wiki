# Hit judgements in Delta Dash

In Delta Dash, the accuracy of the player's taps is assessed based on a hit window that is determined by an algorithm that takes into account the sensitivity of the map.


## Hit Window

The hit window value generated by the formula is used to determine the four levels of accuracy in Delta Dash:

| Hit Judgment | Window Value | Description |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| Perfect      | 1x hit window value | A perfect hit occurs when the player taps the note exactly within the hit window. |
| Good         | 2x hit window value | A good hit occurs when the player taps the note within two times the hit window value. |
| Meh          | 3x hit window value | A meh hit occurs when the player taps the note within three times the hit window value. |
| Miss         | 4x hit window value | A miss occurs when the player fails to tap the note within four times the hit window value. |

## Hit Window Example

Hit windows is altered by mods. The following example shows the hit windows with no mod applied.

| Hit Judgment | Sensivity 0 | sensivity 10 |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| Perfect      | 158.8ms       | 40ms        |
| Good         | 317.6ms       | 80ms        |
| Meh          | 476.4ms       | 120ms       |
| Miss         | 635.2ms       | 160ms       |

A Hitwindow of 158.8ms means that the player has to tap the note within 158.8ms to get a perfect hit.
so 79.4ms before the note reaches the judgement line and 79.4ms after the note reaches the judgement line.

## Associated Colors

When a note is tapped, the Combo Indicator will flash a color that corresponds to the accuracy of the tap. The colors are as follows:
