In Delta Dash, there are 11 mods that can be used to modify gameplay. These mods are categorized into three categories: Easier, Harder, and Spectate.

### Easier

- **No Fail:** Prevents the game from ever giving game overs, making it easier for players to complete maps.
- **Slow Mo:** Reduces game speed to 0.75, making maps easier to play and hit notes accurately.
- **One Side:** Sets every note to come from the right of the screen, allowing players to focus on hitting notes from one direction.

### Harder

- **No Miss:** Instantly fails the player for any missed notes, making maps more challenging.
- **Speedrun:** Increases game speed to 1.5, making maps faster and more difficult to hit notes accurately.
- **Mix Up:** Randomizes note directions, making it more difficult for players to anticipate where the notes will come from.
- **Mirror:** Inverts note directions, making notes come from the opposite side of the screen than they usually would.
- **Hidden:** Hides the notes when they approach the judgement line, making it more difficult for players to hit notes accurately.

### Spectate

- **Auto:** Makes the game play any maps with a perfect score, but does not send a score to the leaderboard.
- **Cinematic:** Hides the entire user interface and shows the background, making it ideal for players to enjoy the design of maps.
