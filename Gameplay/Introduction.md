# Introduction to Gampplay of Delta Dash

In Delta Dash, the player's objective is to manage two rhythm lines that appear on the top and bottom of the screen. The goal is to tap the notes that correspond to the rhythm of the song being played. The player's performance is assessed based on their accuracy.

## Elements in the Game

There are two types of elements in Delta Dash: the single note and the long note.

### Single Note

A single note is a simple straight line that may appear from either side of the screen. The player's objective is to tap the note when it reaches the judgement line in the center of the screen.

### Long Note

A long note is a curved line that may also appear from either side of the screen. The player's objective is to hold the note from the moment it enters the judgement line until it leaves it.
