By accessing the Website and/or registering in-game, you acknowledge that you have read, comprehended, and agreed to be bound by all the terms and conditions outlined in these Terms of Use. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL THESE TERMS OF USE, YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE APP, AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.

Supplementary terms and conditions or documents posted on the App from time to time are expressly incorporated herein by reference. We retain the right, at our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to these Terms of Use periodically. Notification of any changes will be provided by updating the "Last updated" date of these Terms of Use, and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change. Please ensure that you review the applicable Terms each time you use our App to understand which Terms apply. Your continued use of the App after the posting date of any revised Terms of Use implies your acceptance of and awareness of the changes.

The information presented on the App is not intended for distribution to, or use by, any individual or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation, or would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Consequently, individuals accessing the App from other locations do so at their own initiative and are solely responsible for complying with local laws, where applicable.

The App is not specifically designed to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.).

### 16. GOVERNING LAW

These conditions are governed by and interpreted following the laws of France. The use of the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. If your habitual residence is in the EU, and you are a consumer, you additionally possess the protection provided to you by the obligatory provisions of the law of your country of residence. Delta Dash and yourself both agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Paris.

For any legal matters or disputes related to these Terms of Use, the courts of Paris will have non-exclusive jurisdiction.

### 17. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

**Binding Arbitration**

Any dispute arising from the relationships between the parties to this contract shall be determined by one arbitrator, chosen in accordance with the Arbitration and Internal Rules of the European Court of Arbitration, a part of the European Centre of Arbitration with its seat in Strasbourg.
